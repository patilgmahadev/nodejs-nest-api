1-Move code which is used to checking permissions (is admin or not) and checking api Keys to 
different injectable class / function. I dont want to have too much redundant code.

2-Change logic of api key checking. Currently for some endpoints api key is required to make GET 
request. This is ok for f.e. mobile apps or other external services. But for testing and dashboard 
I want to provide only token. If is admin logged in, I dont want to check api keys. So also in 
Swagger api key should be optional parameter.


Here are two firsts tasks. Is it clear? Do you have any questions?
